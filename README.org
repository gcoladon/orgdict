* orgdict
library for converting Emacs org-mode files to a nested Python dictionary, and back 
** Installation

Copy the repo, or the single Python file, and then move it to wherever you want to be able to import it from

** Usage

Using the example.org file from https://writequit.org/denver-emacs/presentations/files/example.org.html

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import orgdict

d = orgdict.read("example.org")
d.keys() # dict_keys(['line', 'content', 'sections'])
len(d['sections']) # 10
d['sections'][0]['title'] # 'This is an example headline'
d['sections'][0]['title'] += "!"
orgdict.write("example!.org", d)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ diff example.org example\!.org
7c7
< * This is an example headline
---
> * This is an example headline!
$
#+END_SRC

** API

Once you've read an org file, you can expect each level of the nested dictionary to have some subset of these fields:

- title: the title of the section
- prologue: whatever comes between the heading and the properties
- properties: a dictionary of properties under this headline
- content: an array of lines that make up the content under this heading up until the first subsection
- sections: an array of dictionaries just like the top level one, for each subheading.
